# 👋 Hi, I'm Kapil Kathiriya

### 🧩 Founding Backend & Blockchain Engineer  
M.Tech CSE — IIT Kanpur

- 🐹 Golang backend engineer focused on **distributed systems & high-throughput APIs**
- 🔍 building **chain-agnostic crypto-forensics & blockchain analytics platforms**
- ⚙️ experience with **ETL/indexers, clustering, graph databases, monitoring & infra**
- 🛠️ worked on **UTXO clustering, cross-chain tracing, risk scoring, DeFi analytics**

---

## 🚀 What I work on

- 🔗 blockchain infrastructure — full nodes, ETL/indexers, P2P monitoring  
- 🧮 large-scale **UTXO clustering & entity attribution**
- 🧭 **cross-chain tracing** and DeFi transaction analysis  
- 🛡️ **address risk-scoring heuristics** and inflow/outflow analytics  
- ⚙️ real-time pipelines, caching, and distributed backend systems in Go

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages**
- Golang (Go), Bash, SQL

**Backend & Systems**
- REST/gRPC APIs, Microservices, Concurrency, Distributed Systems

**Datastores**
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j (Cypher)

**Blockchain**
- Bitcoin • Ethereum • Tron • BSC  
- UTXO & account-based chains  
- full-node setup, ETL/indexers, mempool & P2P analysis

**DevOps & Monitoring**
- Linux (Ubuntu), Docker  
- Grafana, Prometheus, Uptime Kuma

## 📌 Featured Projects (in progress / selected)

🌐 **Blockchain Forensics Toolkit**  
UTXO clustering, entity proximity search, coinjoin heuristics, inflow/outflow calculator, graph queries in Neo4j.

⚙️ **Go-based Blockchain Indexer**  
Lightweight ETL pipeline that indexes chain data into PostgreSQL/Neo4j with caching layers.

🛡️ **Address Risk Scoring Engine**  
Heuristic-based risk score generator using inflow/outflow patterns and entity proximity.

🔁 **API Orchestrator with Backoff & Key Rotation**  
Resilient API layer in Go with exponential backoff, circuit breaking, and multiple API key load balancing.

> 🔒 Production systems I built at work are private — these repos are clean demo versions of concepts I’ve worked on.
